        <p>Have decided to try this blog thing again. I&#39;ve been on several blogging platforms before, but never
lasted because the more seriously I took it, the more frustrated I got with the lack of control and ability to
customize. This time I&#39;ve decided to flip the problem on its head and start with a lean, custom approach.</p>
<p>Which of course means, I rolled my own blogging engine, which I can tinker with at the obvious expense of blogging on it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything will be in markdown, a format I&#39;ve grown to enjoy while writing code documentation. </li>
<li>Posts may be short and choppy, and I&#39;ll expand older posts where appropriate. This non-linear style will
hopefully suit my disjointed, non-linear way of thinking. Plus I&#39;ve always liked the brevity of microblogging, though I feel 
there needs to be something more verbose than Twitter.</li>
<li>It needs to be hosted somewhere easy so I can move it somewhere else when the first hosting option invariably fails. </li>
<li>No database please, databases are the Devil&#39;s toolshed. Flat files are just easier to work with when you&#39;re on a one-man-sized
project. One less major system to maintain, and much easier to version. </li>
</ul>
<p>I ended up implementing it in the tools I know best (NodeJs + Assemble.io), and it was inspired by that seminal Phil Hawksworth
talk I saw at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/philhawksworth/dynamic-static-site-strategies-coldfront-conference?slide=1">Coldfront &#39;14</a>.</p>
<p>It took six time longer then anticipated, but I anticipated one hour.</p>
