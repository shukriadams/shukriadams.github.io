Have decided to try this blog thing again. I've been on several blogging platforms before, but never
lasted because the more seriously I took it, the more frustrated I got with the lack of control and ability to
customize. This time I've decided to flip the problem on its head and start with a lean, custom approach.

Which of course means, I rolled my own blogging engine, which I can tinker with at the obvious expense of blogging on it.

- Everything will be in markdown, a format I've grown to enjoy while writing code documentation. 
- Posts may be short and choppy, and I'll expand older posts where appropriate. This non-linear style will
  hopefully suit my disjointed, non-linear way of thinking. Plus I've always liked the brevity of microblogging, though I feel 
  there needs to be something more verbose than Twitter.
- It needs to be hosted somewhere easy so I can move it somewhere else when the first hosting option invariably fails. 
- No database please, databases are the Devil's toolshed. Flat files are just easier to work with when you're on a one-man-sized
  project. One less major system to maintain, and much easier to version. 

I ended up implementing it in the tools I know best (NodeJs + Assemble.io), and it was inspired by that seminal Phil Hawksworth
talk I saw at [Coldfront '14](https://speakerdeck.com/philhawksworth/dynamic-static-site-strategies-coldfront-conference?slide=1).

It took six time longer then anticipated, but I anticipated one hour.
