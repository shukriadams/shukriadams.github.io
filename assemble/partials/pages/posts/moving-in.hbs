Have decided to try this blog thing again. I've been on several blogging platforms before, but never
lasted because the more seriously I took it, the more frustrated I got with the lack of control and ability to
customize. This time I've decided to change things around a bit.

- Everything will be in markdown, a format I've grown to enjoy writing in while writing code documentation. 
- Posts may be short and choppy, I'll expand older posts where appropriate. This non-linear style will
  hopefully suit my way of thinking.
- Of course, I had to write my own blogging engine to do this - https://github.com/shukriadams/shukriadams.github.io, and knowing me
  I'll spend more time coding on it than actually blogging.
