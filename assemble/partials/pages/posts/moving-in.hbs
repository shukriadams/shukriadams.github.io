Have decided to try this blog thing again. I've been on several blogging platforms before, but never
lasted because the more seriously I took it, the more frustrated I got with the lack of control and ability to
customize. This time I've decided to change things aroaund a bit.

- Everything will be in markdown, a format I've grown to love while doing code documentation.
- Posts will be shorter and choppier, and I'll expand older post where appropriate. This non-linear style will
  hopefully suit my way of thinking.

This blog is hosted on github, and the source code is available at https://github.com/shukriadams/shukriadams.github.io.
