# Moving in

Date : 2018 06 11

Have decided to try this blog thing again. I've been on several blogging platforms before, but never
lasted because the more seriously I took it, the more frustrated I got with the lack of control and ability
customize. This time I've decided to strip things down a bit, and write everything in markdown, a format I've
grown very fond of while coding.

This blog is hosted on github, and the code is available at https://github.com/shukriadams/shukriadams.github.io.
